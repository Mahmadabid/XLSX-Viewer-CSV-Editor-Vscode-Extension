# XLSX & CSV Editor - VS Code Extension

This is an open-source project that allows you to view XLSX files with styles, fonts, and colors from Excel files, supporting multiple sheets. Additionally, it provides a table view and editing capabilities for CSV files directly in VS Code.

## 📌 Overview

XLSX & CSV Editor is a powerful **Visual Studio Code** extension that allows users to **open, view, and edit Excel files (.xlsx)** and **CSV files directly within VS Code**. It provides a seamless, lightweight experience without requiring external software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

**🚨 Important Note**: This extension was previously named **`XLSX Viewer & CSV Editor`**. It has now been renamed to **`XLSX & CSV Editor`** to reflect the added support for CSV file editing.

## 🚀 Features

### XLSX Viewing
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** - View Excel spreadsheets quickly within VS Code\
✅ **Retains Formatting** - Keeps cell styles, colors, and text formatting\
✅ **Multiple Sheet Support** - View all sheets in your Excel workbook\
✅ **Toggle Background Mode** - Easily switch between Light, Dark, and **VS Code** (mirrors editor theme) backgrounds\
✅ **Persistent Theme** - Remembers your last used theme across files and sessions\
✅ **Interactive Table View** - Display spreadsheet data in a structured HTML table\
✅ **Color Detection & Conversion** - Converts ARGB Excel colors into CSS-compatible formats

### XLSX Editing
✅ **In-Table Editing** - Edit XLSX sheets directly in the webview table with **Edit**, **Save**, and **Cancel** actions.
✅ **Undo/Redo & Shortcuts** - Support for <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Y</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate cells while editing.
✅ **Toolbar & Settings Panel** - Toolbar and settings (sticky toolbar, header options, hyperlink preview, toggle header) are available in the XLSX view for quick access and parity with the CSV editor.
✅ **How it works** - Changes are made in the webview and persisted back to the original `.xlsx` file when you click **Save**. The extension uses ExcelJS to write workbook changes while attempting to preserve styles and formatting where possible. **Cancel** discards any unsaved changes.

### Settings for XLSX Editing
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.firstRowIsHeader` — Treat the first row as a header (renders bold).
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.stickyHeader` — Make the header row sticky when enabled.
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.stickyToolbar` — Keep the workbook toolbar fixed at the top of the editor.
- `xlsxViewer.xlsx.hyperlinkPreview` — Show hover previews for hyperlinks with Open/Copy actions.

> ⚠️ Notes & Limitations: Formulas are not automatically recalculated by the webview; very large workbooks or complex charts may be slow to edit. The editor aims to preserve styles and merged-cell behavior where possible.


### 🆕 Merged Cells & Resizing Support
✅ **Merged Cell Support** - Full support for both horizontal and vertical merged cells from Excel files, with proper content alignment and original Excel formatting\
✅ **Interactive Resizing** - Drag column/row borders to resize, with visual resize handles, hover effects, and real-time size indicators\

### 🆕 Excel-like Multi-Selection & Copy
✅ **Multi-Selection for Rows/Columns** - Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to select/deselect multiple rows or columns, <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select a range\
✅ **Excel/Google Sheets Compatible Copy** - Copying and pasting preserves cell structure in Excel/Google Sheets\
✅ **Improved Selection Management** - Visual feedback for multi-row/column selection and selection size info box in the bottom right corner.
